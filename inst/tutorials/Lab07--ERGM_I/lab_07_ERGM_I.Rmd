## Introduction
Welcome to the first of two tutorials about Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs).
An ERGM is a statistical tool to assess causality using hypothesis testing 
when the outcome variable is a network. 

This class of models is employed to assess weather the structure of a network 
is random or whether it is originated by some sort of identifiable relational phenomena.


Let's get started with the art of fitting ERGMs!

## Logit

ERG models conceptualize their outcome variable as 

* absence 
or 
* presence 

of an edge between each pair of node in a given network. This set up makes 
the outcome variable binary and makes them very comparable to logistic 
regression, a class of models that focuses of dummy outcome variables. 

Dummy is as nick name for a binary categorical variable such as 

* yes or no
* black or white
* win or lose
* ...

* edge or no edge

In `r` you fit a logit model using the `glm` function that belongs to r
base. `glm` stands for generalized linear model. 

Now we know two crucial things about logit models

* they have a dummy dependent variable
* they are estimating linear effects. 

When we use statistical models we are referring to the understanding 
of the reason why we observe something, rather than the observation
of repeated behaviors (patterns). 
The study of why something happens is called causal inference, 
since it deals with inferring (estimating) the cause of some phenomenon
of interest. 

Logit models as much as ERGMs explain why a network (outcome variable) is the way
it is, due to some concurrent phenomena that affected it. That's the reason 
why we say that an explanatory variable predicts an outcome variable. 

Scientists explain phenomena by testing hypotheses. 

* You measure something relevant for you:
my dog is often barking like crazy 

* You formulate an hypothesis on the reason why he is barking
He might be hungry

* You test your hypothesis 
mmm maybe I don't feed him enough... 

* Against a null hypothesis
My dog is fine and he barks like crazy for fun

He might be barking for many reasons other than being hungry such as that he 
wants to go for a walk (the phenomenon is more complex), but there is a 
certain probability associated to your hypothesis being correct. 
This hypothesis can be numerically tested measuring how many days in a month
your dog barks like crazy (outcome variable) and how much food he gets every day 
(explanatory variable). 

This is the hypothesis testing mindset!


Let's fit the logit model we discussed in the first ERGM lecture to get 
a better understanding of causality and ERGMs! oh... and please, if you have 
a pet, feed her/him!!

```{r load_SuccessData, include = FALSE}
SuccessData <- SNA4DS:::SuccessData
```

First we take a look at the data

```{r head_success, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "load_SuccessData"}

head(SuccessData)
nrow(SuccessData)

```
We have three variables:

* success: whether our respondents are successful or not (dummy)
* numeracy: how much our respondents are good at math (numeric, continuous)
* anxiety: how much our respondents are anxious (numeric, continuous)

Having these three pieces of information about 50 respondents, 
we can ask three 'why' (causal) questions":

* 1. Does the level of success and numeracy predict the presence of anxious thoughts?
* 2. Does the the level of success and anxiety predict numeracy?
* 3. Does the level of anxiety and the level of numeracy predict success?

Even if the data allow us to fit three models to address these three research 
questions, it is not necessarily a good idea to do it. In fact, questions 
1 and 2 sound a little detached from reality. Why math knowledge should make 
someone anxious (1)? Why an anxious person should be good at math (2)? 
Unless we see other evidence, these make no sense.

If you decide to run a model you need to support your question with 
evidence to persuade your audience that your question makes sense. 
You also need to provide an attempted answer to your question, informed
by the literature you read on the topic. That's an hypothesis. 

Now, we move on with question 3 assuming that we spent some time reading on 
the topic. According to the literature, it is more likely that people good at math
are successful since knowing math allows you to get good jobs. At the same
time, if people work really hard to be successful very often they end up being 
stressed. In accordance, we can formulate the hypothesis:

* H1 The level of anxiety and the level of numeracy are predictors of success.

H1, obviously expects to find effects and it is the opposite of a null hypothesis
of no effect that we call H0

* H0 The level of anxiety and the level of numeracy are not correlated to success.

H1 is a two tailed hypothesis, since we are not stating whether more anxiety and 
more numeracy are leading to more success, or the other way around 
(one tailed options). We are open to both positive and negative correlations.


Then we move on fitting a bunch of models to test H1. Since our outcome variable 
is a dummy, we use a logit model. 
We add the covariates (explanatory variables) one by one, _nesting_ a series 
of models. 

First we consider only numeracy as an explanatory variable
```{r m1_success, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "load_SuccessData"}
SuccessModel1 <- stats::glm(formula = success ~ numeracy, 
                            family = binomial(link = logit), 
                            data = SuccessData)
summary(SuccessModel1)
```

To fit a model in `r` you always have to specify a formula. 
The first variable in the formula is always the outcome variable. Then you 
insert `~` followed by the explanatory variable(s). 
We can check the results using the function `summary` from r base

```{r m2_success, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "load_SuccessData"}
SuccessModel2 <- stats::glm(formula = success ~ numeracy + anxiety, 
                            family = binomial(link = logit), 
                            data = SuccessData)
summary(SuccessModel2)
```

We can add more covariates (expanatory variables) with the `+` sign.

Model two checks whether respondents that are good at math are successful 
in parallel of checking weather respondents that are anxious are successful. 

If we want to see weather respondents that are good and math and anxious 
at the same time are successful, we need to use an interaction. We do that
adding a third term that multiplies the other two (we could also omit the first 
two terms since the `glm` function individually considers already the terms 
specified in the interaction, but it is better to watch every step for now). 
 

```{r m3_success, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "load_SuccessData"}
SuccessModel3 <- stats::glm(formula = success ~ numeracy + anxiety + numeracy * anxiety , 
                            family = binomial(link = logit), 
                            data = SuccessData)
summary(SuccessModel3)
```

That's the final model we consider this time.


## Reading results 

We successfully run our models, but coding is the easy part in this game. 
The real point is: what do these results mean?

In order to understand our results, it is helpful to print them all in once. 
We can do that using the function `screenreg` from the `texreg` package that 
automatically places your nested models' results next to each other, ready for 
comparison.

Again, you interpret ERGMs results the same way as logit models. 
Hence, let's learn it with this easy example, so when things get more complicated,
later, you will know what to do!


```{r logit_Models, include = FALSE}
logitModels <- SNA4DS:::logitModels
```

After saving our three models results into a list, we pass the list to 
`screenreg` from the `texreg`package. This package is there with the only goal 
of printing results for you in several formats, saving you a lot of time. 
`screenreg` prints it directly in the `r` console, or in this tutorial. 
Isn't it handy?

Let's first print the results using p-values.

```{r printResPV, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "logit_Models"}

# logitModels <- list(SuccessModel1, SuccessModel2, SuccessModel3)
texreg::screenreg(logitModels)
```

First of all note that having our results next to each other helps 
in getting an overview of our nested models. Model comparison is really 
important, since our goal it to understand which combination of explanatory 
variables predicts our outcome variable more accurately. 

### Goodness of Fit for nested models' comparison 

Let's check goodness of fit first. We have three indicators:

* AIC. Akaike information criterion
* BIC. Bayesian information criterion
* Log Likelihood

For AIC and BIC, smaller the value better is the model. 
For Log Likelihood, higher the value better is the model.

In our success case, Model one is definitely the worse among the three. 
According to both AIC and BIC model two is the best one. According to the 
log likelihood, Model two and three are equally better than model one.



### P-values

In frequentist statistics we can talk about results significance to underline 
the fact that there is a large probability that your result is not random but 
it is the product of a certain specific phenomena that we observed.

Let's take a look at the results considering p-values. In null hypothesis 
significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results 
at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption 
that the null hypothesis is correct.

This definition is quite hard to get since rather that thinking on the causal 
effects you need to focus on the absence of effects and this twists your brain.

In practice it means that you want to check on the probability that repeating 
your observation for a large number of times, let's say 1000, your results are
special, not at the center of a normal distribution that defines your null 
hypothesis. If your results 'are not special', are not significant -it means 
that your cannot reject the null hypothesis since what you are observing looks 
exactly like H0.

Stars are a convention to present results. In social science one of the most 
popular convention works as such:

* coef *** means that the probability that the null hypothesis is true is < 0.001
That's what you want, since it's very unlikely.
* coef ** means that the probability that the null hypothesis is true is < 0.01
* coef * means that the probability that the null hypothesis is true is < 0.05

Higher than that, it's considered more likely that the null hypothesis is true 
and that you found nothing. Keep in mind that these thresholds are very much 
arbitrary, and they work as rules of thumb.

In our study, model three does not look any different than H0. That combination 
of variables is very likely to output a distribution that equates to the null 
distribution.

In model two numeracy has a 95 % probability of being different from H0 (significant), 
while anxiety has a probability of 99 % of being different from H0 
(significant). In model one, numeracy has a probability of 99.9 % of being 
different from H0 (significant).  

* p-value < 0.05 -- 5% prob of being the same as H0 / 95% prob of being able to reject H0
* p-value < 0.01 -- 1% prob of being the same as H0 / 99% prob of being able to reject H0
* p-value < 0.001 -- 0.1% prob of being the same as H0 / 99.9% prob of being able to reject H0

Ágain, these thresholds are totally arbitrary.
Often p-values are used to comment on the extent to which the explanatory 
variable influences the outcome one. P-value tells us nothing about the 
intensity of an effect, or about H1. It only informs on the probability that 
your effect comes from the same distribution that produced H0. You wish it does not. 

### Confidence Intervals

Let's explore confidence intervals instead of p-values.
`screenreg` also allows us to print confidence intervals
in place of p-values, by specifying the argument `ci.force = TRUE`.

```{r printResCI, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "logit_Models"}

texreg::screenreg(logitModels, ci.force = TRUE)

```


Using confidence intervals we consider that there is an upper and a lower bound. 
If these two values are both positive or both negative there is a high probability that 
H1 results look different than H0 results, hence you are able to reject the null.

In this environment, zero is the null value of the parameter. The upper and the 
lower bound represent a 95% confidence interval in reference to a normal distribution.
If the confidence interval includes the null value (0), then there is no 
statistically meaningful or statistically significant difference between the 
observed data and the data that produce the null (aka it's like random data. 
No effects in there since it's random, null).

The probability of the observed data to different from the hypothesis of no effects
(due to some theory driven reasons) are meaningful if the upper and lower 
bound have the same sign.

While the p-value suggest that significance can be more or less intense, with 
these stars and a bunch of arbitrary thresholds, the confidence interval 
provides more careful suggestions on that, a more prudent way of understanding 
results, that helps to avoid false positives. 

Confidence intervals are not better than p-values per se, but they are good in 
helping researchers not to rely on the arbitrary thresholds that mean absolutely
nothing in real life. 

Confidence intervals can also be plotted with the function`plotreg`. 
A visual understanding of results is always a great help in explaining a
research's output.

```{r plotRes, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "logit_Models"}
texreg::plotreg(logitModels)
```
`plotreg` makes the interpretation of results even easier by showing significant 
results in red with the coefficient represented by a circle, and non-significant 
results in blue with the coefficient represented by a square. 



### Interpreting Coefficients

We can interpret logit models and ERGMs' coefficients with odd ratios and
probabilities.

we can calculate 

* odd ratios (OR) by exponentiation the coefficient. 
* probabilities (P) with the formula: exp(coef)/(1 + exp(coef)) 
 
Let's calculate odd ratios for the model two's coefficients

```{r or, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "logit_Models"}

# we access the coefficients from the summary of each model 
# from the list, taking the first column of the table 
# of stored results  

coefM2 <- summary(logitModels[[2]])$coef[ , 1]

# we exponentiate each of them with a for loop to compute the OR
or <- NULL

for (i in 1:length(coefM2)) {
 
  temp <- exp(coefM2[i])
  
  or <- append(or, temp)
}

cbind(coefM2, or = round(or, 3))

```

How do we interpret the odd ratios? 

First of all, we do not particularly care about the intercept. For now feel 
free to ignore it. We consider an OR of 1.78 for numeracy and an OR of 0.25 for 
anxiety.

Exponentiating the numeracy coefficient tells us the expected increase in the 
odds of success for each unit of numeracy: For each unit increase in numeracy a 
study participant is 1.78 times more likely to have success.

Exponentiating the anxiety coefficient tells us the expected increase in the 
odds of success for each unit of anxiety: For each unit increase in anxiety a 
study participant is 0.25 times more likely to have success 

As a rule of thumb: When the OR is one point something (or higher) the odds are 
high (it's likely that that explanatory variable has an effect on the outcome 
one); when the OR is zero point something the odds are low (it's unlikely that 
that explanatory variable has an effect on the outcome one) .

How about probability?

Can you modify the code I just provided and calculate probabilities in the box
below assuming that the probability vector is called 'P'? Remember also to print
the results.

```{r grade_CoefProb, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "logit_Models"}
coefM2 <- summary(logitModels[[2]])$coef[ , 1]

```

```{r grade_CoefProb-solution}

coefM2 <- summary(logitModels[[2]])$coef[ , 1]

P <- NULL

for (i in 1:length(coefM2)) {
 
  temp <- exp(coefM2[i])/ (1 + exp(coefM2[i]))
  
  P <- append(P, temp)
}

cbind(coefM2, P = round(P, 3))


```


```{r grade_CoefProb-check}
gradethis::grade_code(correct = "Well Done!")
```


How do we interpret probabilities? Easy Peasy. 

There is a 64% probability that numeracy predicts success. 
There is a 20% probability that anxious people are successful. 

Remember that probabilities go from 0 to 1. 
Also, never compare odd ratios and probabilities, they are two different things: 
Pears and Bananas.


## Erdos Renyi

After starting soft from logit models and understanding model results, lets 
finally get started with ERGMs. In this section we are going to run one of the 
simplest ERG models that you can possibly think of. 
To do so we are going to use the Florentine marriage network. You are already 
familiar with this graph, so I won't spend more time on discussing it


```{r florentine_load, include = FALSE}

# data(florentine, package='SNA4DS')
# flo_mar <- florentine$flomarriage

florentine <-SNA4DS:::flomar_network

```

Let's just print and check on its class 

```{r viewflo_mar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}
florentine
class(florentine)

```
This graph has class network, hence all the `igraph` code we used so far, it's 
not going to work. We have to do things a little differently here.
Take this into account. The output with the network features is different from 
`igraph`, but it's still very simple to read. 

We know that we have 16 nodes and 20 edges, that it's undirected, that it has 
three nodes attributes, and no edge ones.

Let's also plot it, just to check
```{r plotflo_mar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}
plot(florentine)
```

Not let's check at the network density in an alternative way:

```{r densityflo_mar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}

summary(florentine ~ edges)

```
yes, they are still 20 out of 16*15 possible edges. 

Ok, let's estimate an ERG model! How? with the `ergm` package from the `statnet`
suite! We are going to use mainly one function. Guess what? `ergm`!

```{r ergmflo_mar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}

flomodel.01 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges)  
(s1 <- summary(flomodel.01))

exp(s1$coefficients[1])/ (1 + exp(s1$coefficients[1])) # prob of edges
```
Here we go. The first part of the output is about the model fit. The second part is
the model summary. The last row is the probability 
Congrats! You run your first ERGM. 

Edges, is a structural term. We are just checking on the probability that 
those 20 edges are not by chance. Could they have been between any family? In 
other words: Do they marry in a random way?
Usually people marry for a reason. Love or some other, but it's unlikely that 
they marry in a random way.
How about this old Florentine folks? Well, according to the model results, they 
did not marry by chance too. P-value is < 0.0001, hence there is a high 
probability that we can reject the null hypothesis of marrying by chance. 
What about the coefficient? The fact that it is negative means that the network 
is sparse. The probability of these edges is 16%. These old Florentine dudes, 
do not marry by chance, and do not marry that easily either. These weddings are 
well thought, and kind of exclusive. It's not for every family to marry there! 

### Simulation

We said that we are checking on the probability that our observed network is 
different from some random others that are built using the same parameters 
but have no effects (null distribution). This means that we are comparing our 
observed Florentine network with many others simulated ones with the same 
parameters: Nodes and Edges. 

In Network Science, a random network with fixed number of nodes and edges is an 
Erdos Renyi one. Let'try

```{r erdos_renyi, exercise = TRUE}
plot(igraph::erdos.renyi.game(16, 20, type = 'gnm'))

```
This network we just plotted is really similar to the Florentine one, but still 
not quite the same. Generating a 1000 of these using this the 
`igraph::erdos.renyi.game` function, we could manually test our null 
hypothesis of no effects . 

Many other times, we have to compare our observed network with no standard 
structures. To do so, in the future, we can simply use the function `simulate`.

```{r simulate_flo, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}
flomodel.01 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges)
simflo <- simulate(flomodel.01, burnin = 1e+6, verbose = TRUE, seed = 9)
plot(simflo)
```
In this case, we have full control on the parameters, since we are explicitly 
asking the function to simulate something that has exactly the same terms as
our `flomodel.01`.

Enough with this easy toy model! we are ready for something juicier!

## P1

The ER ERGM is cute, but it explain reality to a very small extent. In this
section we will take a look at the P1 that is considered ERGM's grandfather.
In fact ERGMs are allo called P* as a better version of the P1 model.

```{r sampson_load, include = FALSE}
sampson <- SNA4DS:::samplike
```

While the ER model can be applied to undirected networks since it only considers
whether there are ties or not (not checking on what kind of ties), the P1 checks 
on the kind of ties and for this reason it requires a directed network. We are
going to use now the Sampson data that you are also already familiar with. 

I'm just going to remind you that it is an ethnographic study of a New England 
monastery's community structure by Samuel F. Sampson.
Social relationships among a group of men (novices) who were preparing to join a 
monastic order.

Let's quickly explore it. 

```{r plotSampson, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "sampson_load"}
sampson 
plot(sampson)

```
This is a subset of the Sampson data that only considers whether the monks like 
each other (directional edge) or not (no edge). We know it's 18 nodes and 88 
edges directed network with no loops and two attributes loaded in the network format.

The P1 model checks on the probability that the observed network is not random, 
but that it's the outcome of some social dynamic focusing on: 

* edges formation (as the ER), 
* sender of the tie, 
* receiver of the ties 
* and the mutuality between sender and receiver.

We are going to use three new ERGM structural terms:

* `sender` 
* `receiver`
* `mutual`

Let's specify our model and print the results! This might take your computer
a few seconds to process, so be patient.

```{r p1Sampson, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "sampson_load"}
P1 <- ergm::ergm(sampson ~ edges + sender + receiver + mutual)

texreg::screenreg(P1, ci.force = TRUE)
```

Waw, what's this output? It's really long! Well, some terms that you specify in 
the ERG models estimate one statistic summarizing the all situation in your 
network. `edges` and `mutual` do so in this case. Some other terms such as 
`sender` and `receiver` compute a statistic for each single node in the network. 
That's why this output is so insanely long. When you choose the terms for your model
take this into account because commenting on each single node in a network with 
200 of them is no fun. 

`sender` and `receiver` look at the probability that each 
single connection is not random: an expression of likelihood between 2 and 5 is completely 
different from one between 5 and 2, as much as one between 12 and 18. This kind 
of approach is perfect for an ethnographic study like this that aims at understanding
specific social dynamics in a small community. It would be not very helpful for 
explaining the behavior in an Twitter network. 

Note that not every node is in the output of the model though. Node number one 
is missing. This is not a mistake. Removing one node is necessary to avoid a 
linear dependency between all the others. Node one constitutes the reference 
category and every other result has to be compared to node one.

For instance, node 10 has a significant sender effect with a probability of the 
89% that is behavior of liking other monks is not by chance. But this value 
makes sense only if compared to the behavior of node one. Monk ten is 89% more likely 
than monk one of liking other monks. That's all we can claim. Changing the 
reference category our results might be slightly different since it changes our
perspective, our point of observation, on this community of monks. However, if 
we assume that these monks share some similarities since they are part of the 
same community, changing the reference category should not drastically modify 
our claims on the non randomness of these ties.

We can also simulate random networks that share the same parameters as the 
Sampson p1 model

```{r simp1Sampson, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "sampson_load"}

P1 <- ergm::ergm(sampson ~ edges + sender + receiver + mutual)

simSam <- simulate(P1, burnin = 1e+6, verbose = TRUE, seed = 9)
plot(simSam)
```
Here we go, it looks very similar indeed, but this is random, while the relationships 
in the original one are socially driven. Isn't it fascinating?


ER and P1 consider only structural effects. When we run them we don't take any 
attribute into consideration. But is not longer going to be the case from the 
next section and afterwards since explaining social reality requires way more 
sophistication that this :) 

## Dyadic Independent Terms

An ERG model is all about finding the best 'dress' to fit our data.

Erdos Renyi and P1 are both models with independent effects since the probability
of observing effects does not depend on the existence of other ties, but only on 
properties of the individual nodes. But, even still focusing only on the effects 
that do not involve edge dependencies, there are many more options. We need to 
Explore more ERGM terms. If you type in your `RStudio` console `search.ergmTerms`,
it will appear to you the help file. Now we focus on the dyadic independent terms
only, that you can print out using the following line of code:


```{r dyad-indepTerms, exercise = TRUE}
ergm::search.ergmTerms(categories = 'dyad-independent')
```

There are 60 terms that correspond to this description! Let's experiment 
one of the most popular: `nodecov`.

```{r nodecov-search, exercise = TRUE}
ergm::search.ergmTerms(name = 'nodecov')
```
The line of code above prints out all you need to know about `nodecov`. 
Let's test it with the Florentine marriage network and one of its attributes, 
wealth. Let's also assume that we are nesting models to explore our network 
further. Hence, we build on `flomodel.01`.

```{r nodecovModel, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}
flomodel.01 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges)  

flomodel.02 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges + nodecov("wealth"))   

texreg::screenreg(list(flomodel.01, flomodel.02), ci.force = TRUE)
```
In this case it is helpful to look at the goodness of fit for model comparison
According to 
* AIC Model two is better.  
* BIC Model one and two are roughly the same, with model two a tiny bit better
* Log Likelihood claims that Model one is better

We will need the GOF that are specific for ERG models to establish which model 
is better representing the social dynamics in the Florentine marriage data set.
For now, we can comment on the `nodecov` term's result and say that there is a high 
probability that we can reject the null hypothesis and that there is a 50% 
probability that wealth is a determinant of marriages in this network.

We can also simulate flomodel.02.

```{r simulate_nodecov, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}
flomodel.02 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges + nodecov("wealth"))  

simNodecov <- simulate(flomodel.02, burnin = 1e+6, verbose = TRUE, seed = 9)
plot(simNodecov)
```
This simulation represent out base line random model. Our Null hypothesis. 


When we use `nodecov` we are computing the correlation of a vector that expresses
the amount of liras that each family owns, and the edge list of the network. 

There are other ways, still in the dyadic independent universe, to check on the 
possibility that wealth influences marriages in the old Florence. 
One term that can help us doing that is `absdiff`

```{r absdiffSearch, exercise = TRUE}
ergm::search.ergmTerms(name = 'absdiff')
```
This term computes the mixingmatrix that calculate the absolute difference
between the amount of money each family owes. Rather than checking whether being 
rich influences the probability of a marriage in old Florence, we check in the 
probability of being equally rich (or equally non-rich). Let's also nest this
models, shouldn't we? 

```{r absdiffModel, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "florentine_load"}
flomodel.01 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges)  

flomodel.02 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges + nodecov("wealth"))   

flomodel.03 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges + absdiff("wealth")) 

flomodel.04 <- ergm::ergm(florentine ~ edges + nodecov("wealth") + absdiff("wealth"))   

texreg::screenreg(list(flomodel.01, flomodel.02, flomodel.03, flomodel.04), ci.force = TRUE)
```
Ok, now we are starting to have something cooler to look at. 

Even if in model two and three our terms are significant, when we put them 
together they are not anymore. This could be because we are trying to estimate 
two effects that are too similar and they interfere with each other. Remember, 
one is estimating a vector and the other a matrix, but the substantive meaning 
is not that different. In general we know that model 4 is not a good fit to our 
network. We are going in the wrong direction and when this happens you simply 
discard that option and test others. 

Anyway, model three shows us that we can reject the null and that the probability 
that being equally rich influences marriages is also around 50%. 


## Conclusion

This is enough for this tutorial! In the next one we are going to cover 
dyadic dependence and goodness of fit. I very much hope that you are looking 
forward! See you at ERGM 2!
